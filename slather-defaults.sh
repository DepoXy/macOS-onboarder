# USAGE:
#
#   # On fresh macOS, run it:
#   cd path/to/macOS-onboarder
#   ./slather-defaults.sh
#
#   # To see list of reminders, and to test script runs, dry-run it:
#   ./slather-defaults.sh --dry-run
#   # Or:
#   ./bin/macOS/onboarder/slather-defaults.sh --dry-run

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# HINTS:
#
# - You can access the global domain three different ways, e.g.,
#
#     defaults write -g <key> <value>
#     defaults write -globalDomain <key> <value>
#     defaults write NSGlobalDomain <key> <value>
#
#   For no reason, or perhaps for readability, this file uses the long format.
#
# - If you're unsure the value type after changing a setting and reading
#   its value, query it:
#
#     defaults read-type <domain> <key>
#
# - NSUserKeyEquivalents characters:
#
#     @ Cmd / ~ Alt / $ Shift / ^ Ctrl
#
# - See also for editing plist files: /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy
#
# - For a count of `defaults write` commands, replace-all in Vim:
#
#     \(^\s\+\)defaults write
#
#   with \1defaults write
#
#   - Today's `defaults write` count: 127.

# LOPRI/2023-01-26: Rename "System Preferences" → "System Settings"

# 2023-01-26: Apple rebranded "System Preferences" → "System Settings"
# in latest macOS Ventura 13.0.1 update.
# - Hopefully this doesn't break too much of my code.
#   - At least the tell-app name is backwards-compatible, e.g., you
#     can call either of these:
#       osascript -e 'tell application "System Preferences" to quit'
#       osascript -e 'tell application "System Settings" to quit'
#   - But it did at least break my Ctrl-q binding, because the menu item
#     was renamed "Quit System Preferences" → "Quit System Settings".
# - At least it's easier to say "System Settings". The "pref" prefix
#   in "Preferences" seems like a tougher English sound to pronounce.

  #   also maps ctrl-shift-(page)up/(page)down, so if you just remember
  #   the ctrl-shift-prefix, you can perform terminal scroll motion.
  # - On macOS, you'll find iTerm maps Cmd-Home/End, and Shift-PageUp/Down
  #   and Cmd-PageUp/Down, which we'll rebind like @linux so that we don't
  #   have to rewire our brains to remember to check which terminal we're

  #   the request and double-checks what type of bike you're riding, and
  #   if you're riding a fixed gear bike, then it'll engage resistance
  #   pedaling instead). This new wirings are fun and all, but they cost
  #   time and energy. And I'd enjoy a more seamless experience, hence
  #   these mappings.

# Keyboard Shortcuts config is a hot mess! Or at least somewhat opaque,
# in that the entries are keyed and valued by integers, so it's not
# obvious what does what without just observing changes in the plist.
# REFER:
#   http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/defaults-symbolichotkeys/
#   https://github.com/diimdeep/dotfiles/blob/master/osx/configure/hotkeys.sh

# Note that I've see two different approaches for writing keys.
# - The `defaults read` shows well-formatted text
#
# - You could write such a key with XML, e.g.,
#
#     defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 124 \
#       "<dict><key>enabled</key><false/><key>value</key><dict><key>parameters</key><array><integer>65535</integer><integer>26</integer><integer>262144</integer></array><key>type</key><string>standard</string></dict></dict>"
#
#   THNKS: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/405937/
#     how-can-i-enable-keyboard-shortcut-preference-after-modifying-it-through-defaul
#
# - Another option I saw is more concise, using what looks like JSON, e.g.,
#
#     defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 73 \
#       "{enabled = 0; value = { parameters = (65535, 53, 1048576); type = 'standard'; }; }"
#
#   THNKS: https://krypted.com/mac-os-x/defaults-symbolichotkeys/ 
#
# FAILD: I tried the shorter command version, but it didn't work.
# - The `defaults read` output looked fine, but neither `/.../activateSettings -u`
#   nor a reboot caused them to take effect. Meanwhile, System Preferences still
#   showed F11, and F11 still Show(ed) Desktop.
# - But using the XML format, a `/.../activateSettings -u` works great, the
#   binding takes effect immediately, and open System Preferences and you'll
#   see the key binding is updated, too.
# - Specifically, this did not work for me:
#     # Doesn't work!
#     defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 36 \
#       "{ enabled = 1; value = { parameters = (100, 2, 786432); type = 'standard'; }; }"
#     defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 37 \
#       "{ enabled = 1; value = { parameters = (100, 2, 917504); type = 'standard'; }; }"
#     # One person online suggested a `defaults read` was necessary after writing.
#     defaults read com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist > /dev/null &&
#     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SystemAdministration.framework/Resources/activateSettings -u
#     # Another person(s) said to reboot, but that didn't work, either.
# - Thankfully (phew! because I don't want to have to do this manually!),
#   the XML varierty works!

# BWARE: I didn't see the com.apple.symbolichotkeys settings populated until
# *after* I opened System Preferences and viewed the Keyboard Shortcuts.
# - BWARE: Obviously, this won't be an issue for me anymore, but it might
#          be a problem when setting up a fresh Mac again.

# 2022-10-18: Yeah, you wish you could set custom keyboard mappings on
# Meld, but ya can't: It has no respect.
# E.g.,
#   - Apple [menu] > System Preferences... > Keyboard [launcher] > Shortcuts [tab]
#     > App Shortcuts [left tab]:
#       Press ``+`` and enter:
#         *Application*: Choose ``Meld.app``
#           - *Menu Title*: ``Quit Meld``
#             *Keyboard Shortcut*: ``Ctrl-Q`` (``^Q``) [Default: ``Cmd-Q``]
#     then run Meld, and you'll see the Meld > Quit Meld menu entry shows
#     the Ctrl-Q that you assigned, but pressing Ctrl-Q has no effect. And
#     then you press Cmd-Q and Meld quits, and so you realize Meld doesn't
#     respect keyboard mappings.
#
# - ANIDA: You wanna be a hero to the Meld community? Make this work.
#
# NOTE: DepoXy use KE to bind Ctrl-q, but now *both* shortcuts work:
#       - Pressing either Cmd-q or Ctrl-q will Quit Meld.
#
# NOTE: Meld has no *Minimize* menu item, which is another common
#       menu item we like to remap.

# GRIPE/2022-11-04: AFAIK, there's no way to *disable* the MacBook notch
# area, aka Camera Housing. *If only you could.*
# - Specifically, I liked being able to throw the cursor to the top of the
#   screen and easily grab the top of a window, or to click on a tab.
#   - E.g., especially with Google Chrome, it was easy to click tabs
#     but moving the cursor to the top of the screen. But now, with
#     the *Notch*, the Chrome bar sits below the vertical notch area,
#     and if you toss the cursor all the way top, it flies past the
#     Chrome window (triggers the menu bar to slide down). So now I
#     have to more careful move the cursor to a tab and click.
# - I was hoping to just disable the whole notch area, so the mouse
#   would stop just below it.
#   - Alas, I could not find a solution online.
#   - At least now when the menu bar appears, it doesn't cover the top
#     of any windows, like it does on non-Notch MacBooks.
# - From my limited searching, I found two notch-related apps, but they
#   simply make the menu bar black so that the notch isn't noticeable,
#   which is not an issue on my MacBook (perhaps because my background
#   is black):
