# BWARE/2023-02-27: This script untested since recent changes
#                   while author awaits new macOS device.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# USAGE: Add your preferred Brew formula and tasks to the BREW_APPS array.
#
#        But please put *PROMPTY* formula and casks *first*.
#
#        - Some installs require the admin password, and we want
#          to nab the user's attention only when they first run
#          this script, and not when they return 5 minutes later
#          after a tea break to find the script paused for input.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# BWARE: These install(s) prompt the user! **PROMPTY**

# *Powerful* keyboard customization.
# - PROMPTS: Requires admin password.
# - CALSO: See also Hammerspoon automator (installed below).
BREW_APPS+=("--cask karabiner-elements")

# --------------------------

# - ADMIN: On some client machines, you may need to start an
#   *Admin Access* terminal session to install GIMP.
#   - So this command is potentially **PROMPTY**.
# - F_Y_I: There's also McGIMP [BREW_APPS+=("--cask mcgimp")]
#   - It's a user compile with additional plugins, include G‚ÄôMIC,
#     Google‚Äôs NIC collection, and a panoramic stitcher.
#       https://techtips101.wordpress.com/2017/10/05/mcgimp-gimp-gmic-more/
#     So unlikely you'll care unless you're a GIMP power user.

# Readline is a dependency for many apps, so might as well be explicit
# about it here (and then we can talk about it in front of its back).
# - Mainly, I want to mention that there's no /etc/inputrc on macOS,
#   so if you're coming from Linux and are used to Ctrl-Left/Right
#   mapping to 'backward-word'/'forward-word', among a handful of
#   other default bindings, you won't find them on macOS by default.
#   - If you're not using the DepoXy development environment, you can
#     simply copy /etc/inputrc from any Linux machine into your personal
#     ~/.inputrc file.
#   - Or, if you are using DepoXy, look at the home/.inputrc file.
BREW_APPS+=("readline")

# --------------------------

# Install commands with "g"-prefixes.
# - Link some from ~/.local/bin using their normal names,
#   so that Homefries and DepoXy scripts will use them.
# - Alternatively, you could add `gnubin` to PATH to link them all, e.g.,
#   `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"`. But that
#   might cause issues, say, if some tool you use expects the non-GNU
#   version. Or, more likely, the Homebrew version runs markedly slower
#   than the built-in app (I'm talking about you, `grep` (see below)).
#   So it's better to leave each GNU app off PATH until you realize you
#   need it, and then link what you need individually, which also means
#   you'll be on the lookout for any issues that may cause.

# Don't bother with Brew git.

#   those found in https://github.com/landonb/git-smart,
#   or https://github.com/landonb/git-my-merge-status).
# - If you do install it, I'd advise against linking it:
#     # USER_LINK+=("git git")
#   And I'd suggest sticking with system git, e.g.,
#     ln -s /usr/bin/git ~/.local/bin/git

# - The `brew tap aykamko/tag` suggested by the README is incorrect:

#   Because `brew tap <user>/<repo>` is a shortcut to
#           `brew tap <user>/<repo> https://github.com/<user>/homebrew-<repo>`,
#   and there is no https://github.com/aykamko/homebrew-tag project.

# - 2022-10-28: I first installed Docker Desktop from a DMG and it worked great.
#   Then I uninstalled Docker Desktop and installed colima and the docker standalone

# 2022-10-16: GhostTile won't hide Finder, nor Pulse Secure, and I've got
# nothing else I want to hide, so not useful to me (with my latest client
# machine).
# - In the past I used it to keep Cisco AnyConnect out of the Dock
#   (which I could access from the menu bar, and only needed to run
#   once a day, so was otherwise wasting valuable Dock real estate).

# Ctrl-space shows fuzzy-find-enabled window list menu.
#   https://contexts.co/
# - Author has been looking for something like MATE's window-list
#   that I can use to quickly access specific windows with the mouse.
#   - Mission Control sorta works, but users can order window-list how
#     they like, so you can find a window just knowing where it "lives"
#     in the mate-panel window-list.
#   - Contexts is obviously different than window-list, but it shows a
#     compact, concise list of windows labeled and ordered well enough
#     to make it easy to find what I'm looking for ‚Äî and allows me to
#     click to open or to use the keyboard. Which is what I'm looking
#     for, a convenient window switcher different than Alt-Tab,
#     different than Mission Control, different than the Dock, etc.
# - USAGE: Run Contexts.app via Spotlight to install it ‚Äî Enable
#   Accessibility permissions, and wire to auto-start on boot.
#   - Also run Contexts via Spotlight to open its settings GUI ‚Äî
#     because that window hides when it loses focus ‚Äî or use
#     the Contexts <Ctrl+Space> menu to raise the hidden window.
